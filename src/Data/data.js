Reaching only 6 inches in height, Aloe castilloniae can eventually grow on to form a dense mat of foliage up to several feet in width! The kelly green leaves are dotted with maroon ridges along both their margins and their upper surface, creating an especially eye-catching appearance.While this variety, like all Aloe plants, is known to be quite forgiving of neglect, it is possible to over-care for your succulent, especially in the form of overwatering. To avoid this fate, be sure to follow the ‘soak and dry’ method of watering, and ensure that your plant is housed in porous soil within a well-draining pot. Furthermore, plenty of bright sunlight, in combination with sufficient airflow around the leaves and soil surface, will ensure healthy, robust growth and will maintain the rich coloration of Aloe castilloniae.',

Like other varieties of Lithops, this specimen can be tricky when it comes to water – be sure to provide thorough but infrequent drinks during the spring and fall, ceasing to water entirely during the summer and winter.

During the summer months, white blooms with hundreds of yellow stamens will emerge from the cleft between the leaves, adding yet another layer of whimsy to this dainty member of the mesembs, or mimicry plant, family.The blooms and old leaf pairs will begin to fade and shrivel at the end of the fall season, acting as a built-in indicator of when to stop watering, not resuming until the weather warms in the spring. Until then, be sure to shield ‘Aurea’ from freezing temperatures, which could otherwise damage the very water-rich leaves.',
